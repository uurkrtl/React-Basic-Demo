## Coding: React Project Setup

Create a new React project with Vite and set up the basic structure.

* Step 1: Create a component called Blog and add it to App.tsx.
* Step 2: Take your blog from the HTML task and recreate it in React. Divide your blog thoughtfully into components. The components should come together in the Blog component.
* If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

## Bonus

Wow, you're fast! If you like, additionally work on this optional bonus task.

* Bonus: Create a component called profile (which should be at the same level as the Blog component in App.tsx) that introduces you as a developer. Use the React basics you have learned so far.
